<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a first-year Ph.D student at the [School of Computer Science, Wuhan University](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Bo Du](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Shy1gnMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Prof. Juhua Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wN-rIgIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I work closely with [Dr. Jing Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9jH5v74AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I previously interned at JD Explore Academy and iFLYTEK Research.

My research interest includes Computer Vision, Large Language Model, and Multimodal Large Language Model. I previously focused on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) related topics. Now, my research interest lies in Multimodal Large Language Model. In addition, I closely follow the latest developments in Large Language Model.
